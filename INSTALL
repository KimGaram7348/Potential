Potential is built on top of the Haskell Platform.
Requires GHC 6.12 and the Haskell Platform.  Download from:
        http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/

To build the standard library:
  $ cd libpotential
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=$HOME --user
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install

To build the compiler (this requires the standard library):
  $ cd compiler
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure --prefix=$HOME --user
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install

This will install the Potential Standard Library into $HOME/lib and the
Potential Compiler into $HOME/bin.  ghc will be able to use the Potential
Standard Library without any changes to your system configuration; use of
the Potential Compiler will require you to explicitly reference $HOME/bin/pc
or modify your system's PATH variable to include $HOME/bin.
